#### <strong>Week:</strong>
November 1st - November 7th
#### <strong>Meeting Location:</strong>
ISR Lounge Area
#### <strong>Time:</strong>
6:00 PM - 7:20 PM
#### <strong>Summary:</strong>
This meeting we worked on our Final Project Proposal, while discussing the specifics of our project idea and potential applications of traversals. To complete the project, we decided to  outline the basic structure of our program, by detailing the contents included within our classes, and constructing methods that are necessary to access specific parts of data. There was also a discussion on the specific data structures that we wanted to implement, such as minHeap and maps. This week, we finished up our Team Contract and Final Project Proposal, writing both of them as Markdown files and committing them to our project repository.

#### <strong>Week:</strong>
November 8th - November 14th
#### <strong>Meeting Location:</strong>
ISR Lounge Area
#### <strong>Time:</strong>
6:00 PM - 7:20 PM
#### <strong>Summary:</strong>
For this meeting, we mainly discussed about the code we've written since last week, as well as discussing possible implementations about our graph constructor.
The main idea we want to implement is starting from our parent reddit, r/uiuc, and reading in all the subreddits based on each user. From there, we will make new nodes and create connections between r/uiuc and neighboring subreddits.

We have currently finished data gathering, and will now focus on updating the graph constructor, as well as creating tests for our written code. The outline for the graph constructor has been drafted, and a test folder has been made to place all the appropriate tests.

These are the following plans that we would like to address:
1. Change timeline to do BFS before dijkstra
2. Amend meetings to be remote to accommodate group members.

This week's work: 
Khanh: implement Dijkstra; Natasha: test graph constructor and BFS traversal; Larry: Graph constructor.

#### <strong>Week:</strong>
November 22th - November 28th
#### <strong>Meeting Location:</strong>
Discord
#### <strong>Time:</strong>
6:00 PM - 6:30 PM
#### <strong>Summary:</strong>
We finished the constructor and discussed on optimizing and small changes to the constructor. The constructor produces promising results but we still need to test it properly, which we also discussed how to make tests. We also planning on spliting the work for making a visualization of the graph and hope to have most of everything done by next Friday.

This week's work: 
Khanh: implement Dijkstra; Natasha: make tests for graph and BFS; Larry: implements BFS

#### <strong>Week:</strong>
November 29th - December 5th
#### <strong>Meeting Location:</strong>
Discord
#### <strong>Time:</strong>
6:00 PM - 6:20 PM
#### <strong>Summary:</strong>
This week, we made major progress on the project. First, we adjusted the constructor class, completed our BFS traversal, and implemented the Dijkstra's algorithm. Additionally, we started on our goal to create a force-directed diagram of the nodes, finishing a basic GraphVisualiztion class and starting on the PhysicsSimulation class. In this next week, we aim to complete the physics simulation and create tests for all of our existing classes. We hope to finish programming and debugging before the weekend so we can complete our final report and record our presentation.
